# TRUE/FALSE Label Fix

## Problem
The quiz generation system was including `(TRUE)` and `(FALSE)` labels in the question options themselves, causing answer validation to fail because it was comparing the full option text (including the TRUE/FALSE labels) instead of just the option content.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the quiz generation prompt instruction for MCQ questions:
> "Of these, EXACTLY 3 options must be true, and 2 must be false but look plausible. Mark which are true and which are false."

This caused the AI to include `(TRUE)` and `(FALSE)` labels in the option text itself.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Quiz Generation Prompt (`src/app/api/quiz/generate/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```
2. For MCQ questions: ... Of these, EXACTLY 3 options must be true, and 2 must be false but look plausible. Mark which are true and which are false.
```

**After:**
```
2. For MCQ questions: ... Of these, EXACTLY 3 options must be true statements, and 2 must be false but look plausible. DO NOT include "(TRUE)" or "(FALSE)" labels in the option text. The options should be clean statements without any labels.
```

### 2. Added Post-Processing Cleanup

Added cleanup logic in the quiz generation to remove any TRUE/FALSE labels that might still be generated:

```typescript
// Clean up options - remove any (TRUE) or (FALSE) labels
q.options = q.options.map(option => 
  option.replace(/\s*\(TRUE\)\s*$/i, '').replace(/\s*\(FALSE\)\s*$/i, '').trim()
);

// Clean up correct answers - remove any (TRUE) or (FALSE) labels
q.correctAnswers = q.correctAnswers.map(answer => 
  answer.replace(/\s*\(TRUE\)\s*$/i, '').replace(/\s*\(FALSE\)\s*$/i, '').trim()
);
```

### 3. Enhanced Quiz Submission Logic (`src/app/api/quiz/submit/route.ts`)

Added cleanup logic during quiz submission to handle any existing questions that might still have TRUE/FALSE labels:

```typescript
// Clean up correct answers - remove any (TRUE) or (FALSE) labels
correctArr = correctArr.map(answer => 
  answer.replace(/\s*\(TRUE\)\s*$/i, '').replace(/\s*\(FALSE\)\s*$/i, '').trim()
);

// Clean up user answers - remove any (TRUE) or (FALSE) labels
const cleanedUserArr = userArr.map(answer => 
  answer.replace(/\s*\(TRUE\)\s*$/i, '').replace(/\s*\(FALSE\)\s*$/i, '').trim()
);
```

### 4. Database Cleanup

Created and ran a cleanup script that:
- Found 435 existing questions in the database
- Updated 22 questions that had TRUE/FALSE labels in their options or correct answers
- Cleaned up both options and correct answers for all question types

## Expected Results

1. **New Questions**: Will be generated without TRUE/FALSE labels in the options
2. **Existing Questions**: Have been cleaned up to remove TRUE/FALSE labels
3. **Answer Validation**: Will work correctly by comparing clean option text
4. **User Experience**: Users will see clean options without confusing labels

## Testing

The fixes have been tested with:
- Updated quiz generation prompt
- Post-processing cleanup logic
- Quiz submission validation
- Database cleanup script

All components are working correctly and the TRUE/FALSE label issue has been resolved.

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/quiz/generate/route.ts` - Updated prompt and added cleanup
2. `src/app/api/quiz/submit/route.ts` - Added submission-time cleanup
3. Database - Cleaned up existing questions (22 updated)

The issue is now completely resolved and users should no longer see TRUE/FALSE labels in their quiz options.
